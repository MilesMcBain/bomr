# bomr

An R package to make it easier to access data from the Australian Bureau of Meterology

This isn't really an R package as yet, I just wanted to get the framework laid down in preparation for the unconference, so we can start somewhere.

The example dataset is the .csv file: "IDCJAC0009_040245_1800_Data.csv", which contains actual data from BOM that I obtained using the process outlined in the .Rmd document in /example_docs/

In /example_docs/ there is also a gist written by Bob Rudis, which could serve as a starting point.
